included tutorials:

* RESTful implementation and test with MockMVC/RestTemplate; deployable on Tomcat with Java-based Config; HTTP Basic security [from http://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/]

* MongoDB persistent via MongoTemplate and Spring Data repository hierarchy (e.g., CrudRepository); config class to map to a JPA database, and use Spring Data JPA Repository to store and retrieve data from H2 database; support GemFire by launching a local cache server to save/retreive objects with GemFireTemplate OQL and GemfireRepository; support of calable and event-driven architecture (propagated message across application cluster) with GemFire Continuous Queries [from http://spring.io/guides/tutorials/data/]
