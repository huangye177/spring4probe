# What is spring4probe

**spring4probe** is a set of prototype tests on the capability of Springframework 4.X

## Prerequisites 

Service installation:

* MongoDB 

* H2

* Redis (http://redis.io/download)

============

## How to

##### [ **Must** ] Start MongoDB

* `mongod` (in MongoDB directory)

##### [ **Must** ] run a Gemfire Server (for Gemfire test cases)

* `gradle runGemfire` 

start a basic GemFire server with a Region **on port 40404** -- a logical partition within GemFire named as 'YummyNoodleOrder'

##### [ **Must** ] run a Redis Server (for Redis test cases)

* `src/redis-server` (in Redis directory)

##### [ **Recommended** ] run from web container:

* `gradle build tomcatRunWar` 

(default) visit http://localhost:8080/ (for page requesting authentication, user name: "http", password: "http")

(alternative by comment `com.yummynoodlebar.config.WebAppInitializer` to ensure use of `rest.yummynoodlebar.config.WebAppInitializer`) visit http://localhost:8080/aggregators/orders to get an empty page with "[]" through HTTP authentication "http:http"

##### [ **Recommended** ] run from tests:

* `gradle clean test` 

primary test cases: `rest.yummynoodlebar.rest.controller`, `data.yummynoodlebar.persistence.integration`, `com.yummynoodlebar.web.controller`

##### [ **Optional** ] run application directly:

* `gradle [runAPP]` (for example: `gradle runScheduleTaskApp`)

Other APP options: `runScheduleTaskApp`; `runConsumeRESTApp`; `runRedisApp`; 

code package: `io.spring`
