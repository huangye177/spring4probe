# What is spring4probe

**spring4probe** is a set of prototype tests on the capability of Springframework 4.X

## Prerequisites 

database installation:

* MongoDB 

* H2

============

## How to

##### [ **Must** ] Start MongoDB

* `mongod`

##### [ **Must** ] run a GemFire server

* `gradle run` 

start a basic GemFire server with a Region **on port 40404** -- a logical partition within GemFire named as 'YummyNoodleOrder'

##### [ Optional ] run from web container:

* `gradle build tomcatRunWar` 

(default) visit http://localhost:8080/ 

(alternative by comment `com.yummynoodlebar.config.WebAppInitializer` to ensure use of `rest.yummynoodlebar.config.WebAppInitializer`) visit http://localhost:8080/aggregators/orders to get an empty page with "[]" through HTTP authentication "http:http"

##### [ Optional/Recommended ] run from tests:

* `gradle clean test` 

primary test cases: `rest.yummynoodlebar.rest.controller`, `data.yummynoodlebar.persistence.integration`, `com.yummynoodlebar.web.controller`
